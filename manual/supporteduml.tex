\section{Supported UML}

Modelio supports a wide range of elements defined in \textcite{OMGUML}.
LogixUML, however, is only capable of converting a subset of these into
add-on instructions. This section describes the UML elements supported
by LogixUML, along with details on how they are implemented in the output
AOIs.


\subsection{State Machines}

The name of the resulting add-on instruction will be the state machine's
name prefixed with \identifier{stateMachine\_}, e.g. exporting a state
machine named \identifier{monitor} will yield a
\identifier{stateMachine\_monitor} add-on instruction.
The state machine name must therefore conform to the convention defined
in \textcite[Chapter~2]{AOI}.

Behavior of the state machine add-on instruction for the various scan
modes is as follows.

\begin{description}
  \item[Prescan] All outputs are set to zero. Any information regarding
    the active state or transition is reset. The event queue, which is
    covered in~\S\ref{??}, is emptied.

  \item[True] The rung-out condition and \identifier{active} output are set
    true. Event inputs are evaluated to detect rising edges. The state machine
    operates starting with its initial transition. The entry, exit, and
    do outputs are energized according to the state machine's condition.

  \item[False] Same as Prescan with the addition that the state machine
    remains inert, not evaluating or responding to any event inputs.
\end{description}

\subsection{Initial Pseudostates}


\subsection{Regions}

As discussed in~\S\ref{ss:states}, LogixUML supports only simple and
composite states. Simple states have no regions, and composite states
can have only a single region containing the initial pseudostate and
all substates.

A region can be activated in two ways per \textcite[\S14.2.3.2]{OMGUML}:
\introTechnicalTerm{default activation} or
\introTechnicalTerm{explicit activation}.
Figure~\ref{fig:regionDefaultActivation} shows the two cases where
default activation is applicable due to a transition terminating
on the boundry of a composite state. The transition triggered by
event \identifier{e1} will complete with state \identifier{super1}
active, but will not enter state \identifier{sub1}.
Since composite state \identifier{super2} includes an initial
pseudostate, the transition triggered by event \identifier{e2} will
result in entering both \identifier{super2} and \identifier{sub2}.

An example of explicit activation is depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:regionExplicitActivation}, where the transition triggered
by event \identifier{e} terminates on the contained substate
\identifier{sub1}. In this case, states \identifier{super1} and
\identifier{sub1} are entered;
state \identifier{sub2} is not entered because the initial pseudostate
applies only when the region is entered with default activation per
\textcite[\S14.2.3.7]{OMGUML}.

\subsection{Transitions}


\subsection{Events}


\subsection{Stereotypes}

Only the stereotype defined by the LogixUML module,
\identifier{stateMachineAoi}, is permitted, and it must be applied to
every state machine that will be exported to an add-on instruction.
See \S\ref{??} for additional details.


\subsection{Notes}

Note elements may be attached to any element. Their presence and content
are ignored by LogixUML.
