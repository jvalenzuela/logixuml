\section{Supported UML}

Modelio supports a wide range of elements defined in \textcite{OMGUML}.
LogixUML, however, is only capable of converting a subset of these into
add-on instructions. This section describes the UML elements supported
by LogixUML, along with details on how they are implemented in the output
AOIs.


\subsection{State Machines}

The name of the resulting add-on instruction will be the state machine's
name prefixed with \identifier{stateMachine\_}, e.g. exporting a state
machine named \identifier{monitor} will yield a
\identifier{stateMachine\_monitor} add-on instruction.
The state machine name must therefore conform to the convention defined
in \textcite[Chapter~2]{AOI}.

Behavior of the state machine add-on instruction for the various scan
modes is as follows.

\begin{description}
  \item[Prescan] All outputs are set to zero. Any information regarding
    the active state or transition is reset. The event queue, which is
    covered in~\S\ref{??}, is emptied.

  \item[True] The rung-out condition and \identifier{active} output are set
    true. Event inputs are evaluated to detect rising edges. The state machine
    operates starting with its initial transition. The entry, exit, and
    do outputs are energized according to the state machine's condition.

  \item[False] Same as Prescan with the addition that the state machine
    remains inert, not evaluating or responding to any event inputs.
\end{description}


\subsection{States}
\label{ss:states}


\subsection{Initial Pseudostates}

Initial pseudostates are supported in two contexts: at the state machine's
top-level region, and within a composite state. The following requirements
apply to both:

\begin{itemize}
  \item There can be at most one initial pseudostate in a region.

  \item An initial pseudostate must have exactly one outgoing transition.

  \item The outgoing transition must not have a triggering event.
\end{itemize}

A state machine must have an initial pseudostate defining its behaviour
immediately after the AOI is scanned true; the departing transition may lead
to any state. Initial pseudostates are optional for composite states,
and if present, must terminate on a substate directly or indirectly contained
by the region owning the initial pseudostate.

Figure~\ref{fig:initialPseudostateCompositeStates} contains examples of
initial pseudostates in composite states. State \identifier{superX}
contains a valid initial pseudostate with a transition leading to
a contained substate; \identifier{subY} would also be a valid target
for this transition. The initial pseudostate in \identifier{s1} is
ill-formed because the target state, \identifier{s2}, is not contained within
the same region.

\subsection{Regions}

As discussed in~\S\ref{ss:states}, LogixUML supports only simple and
composite states. Simple states have no regions, and composite states
can have only a single region containing the initial pseudostate and
all substates.

A region can be activated in two ways per \textcite[\S14.2.3.2]{OMGUML}:
\introTechnicalTerm{default activation} or
\introTechnicalTerm{explicit activation}.
Figure~\ref{fig:regionDefaultActivation} shows the two cases where
default activation is applicable due to a transition terminating
on the boundry of a composite state. The transition triggered by
event \identifier{e1} will complete with state \identifier{super1}
active, but will not enter state \identifier{sub1}.
Since composite state \identifier{super2} includes an initial
pseudostate, the transition triggered by event \identifier{e2} will
result in entering both \identifier{super2} and \identifier{sub2}.

\plantUmlFigure{regionDefaultActivation}
               {Entering regions via default activation.}

An example of explicit activation is depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:regionExplicitActivation}, where the transition triggered
by event \identifier{e} terminates on the contained substate
\identifier{sub1}. In this case, states \identifier{super1} and
\identifier{sub1} are entered;
state \identifier{sub2} is not entered because the initial pseudostate
applies only when the region is entered with default activation per
\textcite[\S14.2.3.7]{OMGUML}.

               {Entering a region with explicit activation.}


\subsection{Transitions}


\subsection{Events}

The implementation of events is based on \introTechnicalTerm{ChangeEvents}
as described in \textcite[\S13.3.3.3]{OMGUML}, with a boolean AOI input
serving as the \introTechnicalTerm{changeExpression}. LogixUML extracts
the string entered in the \inputField{Received event} property for
all transitions
in the state machine, and defines a boolean input parameter for each,
adding the \identifier{event\_} prefix. Since events are used to create
input parameters, their names must be valid add-on instruction parameter
names.

Event inputs are edge-sensitive; the add-on instruction interprets the
input rising edge as an event occurrence. Furthermore,
the rising edge must occur after the AOI is initially scanned true.
The timing diagram shown in Figure~\ref{fig:eventFirstScan} illustrates
event input edge detection. The AOI is first scanned true at scan~1, and
energzies its \identifier{active} output; this can be a result of either
the processor's first scan or if the AOI has conditional rung-in
conditions which transition from false to true.
The input for event \identifier{e1} also transitions true at scan~1, but
is ignored as it did not occur after the AOI's initial scan true.
Scan~2 presents the AOI with a rising edge for event \identifier{e2},
which is interpreted as an event occurrence and handled accordingly.

\plantUmlFigure{eventFirstScan}
               {Event inputs at first scan.}

A simple method for generating an event for conditions that may be
true when the AOI is first scanned true is to use the AOI's
\identifier{active} output as a series condition for energizing the
event's input. The \identifier{active} output is unconditionally energized
when the AOI is first scanned, which will generate a rising edge on the
next scan.

Events can be reused to trigger multiple transitions by using the
same name as the \inputField{Received event} for several transitions.
The only restriction is the same event cannot trigger more than
one transition originating from a given state.
Event names are not case-sensitive as they are used to generate AOI input
parameters, which are also case-insensitive, so events that differ only in
case will be considered the same.

The transitions shown in Figure~\ref{fig:duplicateEvent} provide an example
of event reuse, all of which will yield two AOI input parameters:
\identifier{event\_x} and \identifier{event\_y}.
The transitions originating from state \identifier{s1} are invalid because
both are triggered from the same event, \identifier{y},
resulting in ambiguity in determining which to execute in response to the event.
The transitions triggered by event \identifier{x} are valid, even though both
are enabled in the context of state \identifier{sub}.
Transitions originating from a substate have priority over those
from a containing superstate per \textcite[\S14.2.3.9.4]{OMGUML}, so
event \identifier{x} would cause a transition to \identifier{s2} if the
state machine is in \identifier{sub}, or to \identifier{s1} if the state
machine is in \identifier{super} but not \identifier{sub}.

\plantUmlFigure{duplicateEvent}
               {Duplicate event names.}

Modelio's default theme settings do not show a transition's triggering
event in the diagram. Event names can be made visible by selecting
\menu{Configuration > Diagram themes}, and enabling the
\directory{Transition / Show label} option.


\subsection{Stereotypes}

Only the stereotype defined by the LogixUML module,
\identifier{stateMachineAoi}, is permitted, and it must be applied to
every state machine that will be exported to an add-on instruction.
See \S\ref{??} for additional details.


\subsection{Notes}

Note elements may be attached to any element. Their presence and content
are ignored by LogixUML.
